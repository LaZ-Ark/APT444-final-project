# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
We will likely meet at least every Tuesday for at least an hour. We won't use any software as we plan to meet in person for our meetings. We do not plan to take notes generally, but if we have an idea or topic we would need to circle back to at a later occasion, we could message the idea to the group during the meeting if needed.

2. **Assistance** 
We are all able to call and text each other on various platforms, so there should be no issue when trying to reach the other members. We all have various classes and other responsibilities, so it is expected that people should respond within 8 hours or less if possible.

3. **Respect** 
We are all good friends, so there are no barriers that would keep someone from being comfortable sharing their ideas. We always check with the whole group before agreeing to any choice that would affect the group or project. We are also able to hold each other accountable to make sure everyone engages with the project.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We are able to acknowledge each of our strengths, so generally, we plan to share the work or at least make sure everyone is included in the development process. As we work through each week, we can also share the workload with others if we need help due to other assignments arising from other classes.

5. **Time Commitment** 
We each have other classes and projects we have to work to dedicate time to, so it is generally expected that each person will be at the meetings and work 1 - 2 hours on any of their parts. If one part is taking more time than expected and help is needed, we can always meet and decide what changes need to be made in the future to guarantee we get all our work done.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
We do not expect to have any situations that would require us to inform the course staff. Ultimately we expect to hold each other accountable, and if an issue would arise, we trust that we could help out a team member if they were in need of extra help or be flexible in the case of time conflicts, as time conflicts are expected to be our biggest source of any type of conflict.
